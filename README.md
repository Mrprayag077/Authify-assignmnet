## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**

  - React
  - Javascript
  - TailwindCSS
  - React Router

- **Development Tools:**
  - VS Code
  - Git and GitHub

## Architecture

The application follows a simple **single-page application** (SPA) architecture using React. The app is divided into several reusable components like `Header`, `Login`, `ProtectedRoute`, `HeaderTitle`, and `AboutMe`.

- **Routing:** React Router is used for navigation between different pages (e.g., Home, Profile, Login).
- **Session Management:** Firebase Authentication is used to manage user login and session persistence. If a user is already logged in, they will be automatically redirected to the Home page.
- **Responsive Design:** TailwindCSS is used for responsive UI. The layout adjusts based on screen size to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
